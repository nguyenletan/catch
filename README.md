## Technical stacks:
- Bootstrap Css for responsive UI
- Use create-react-app to setup project, it help us to focus on code, not build tools
- Apply Axios for ajax call, IE 11 does not support Fetch API
- Styled Component for CSS in JS, it can make dead code elimination easier to manage
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit test.
- Apply react-app-polyfill/ie11 fo support ie11 browser
